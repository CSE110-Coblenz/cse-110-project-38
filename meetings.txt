SPRINT 1

Sprint Planning
Date: 11/3/2025
Main Objective: Divide the first user story’s tasks and assign 1 screen to each one.
Details:
Start working on the first user story (As a user, I want to be able to smoothly navigate through the game so that I can choose and play each level at will.)
Decided to work on the screen view for the first sprint.
Look over the first user story’s tasks and assign one screen to each. (Anthony - Level Select, Nick - Game Screen, Alexander - Main Menu Screen and Results Screen)

Stand-Up
Date: 11/5/2025
Main Objective: Show a quick demo of our screens.
Details:
Make sure our screen elements (i.e. buttons, text) are dynamically declared so that they adjust to different screen sizes.
Resolve the miscommunication of Nick and Alexander working on the same screen.
Showed a quick demo of the different screens.

Sprint Review (Retrospective)
Date: 11/9/2025
Main Objective: Merge our individual branches to main, through pull requests, and make sure we can link all screens together.
Details:
Merged our branches to main.
Start working on resolving the merging conflicts because gamescreen was used for both the level screen and the level select screen. Solution: put all level screens to the screen switcher.
After solving the merge conflict, pull the new main onto local machines and make sure it runs without errors.
Cleaned up details about universal sizing and expandability for level template
Todo before the next meeting, resolve merge conflicts and create "test screens" to navigate to placeholders for levels.
For Monday, work on organizing the level select screen and make sure we can navigate through the different screens.
